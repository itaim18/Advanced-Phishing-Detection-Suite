## Overview 🔍

In today’s digital landscape, phishing messages evolve continuously, rendering manual detection increasingly unreliable. This project leverages advanced deep learning models to analyze email text and detect phishing attempts with high accuracy. By combining robust natural language processing (NLP) techniques with modern neural architectures, our solution addresses the nuances of phishing language and tactics. 💡

---

## Features ✨

- **Deep Learning Powered 🤖:** Utilizes cutting-edge deep learning models (e.g., LSTM, CNN, or Transformer-based architectures) for efficient phishing detection.
- **Automated Classification ⚡:** Classifies emails into “Legitimate” or “Phishing” categories in real time.
- **NLP Preprocessing 📝:** Integrates comprehensive text preprocessing steps including tokenization, embedding generation, and sequence modeling.
- **Modular & Scalable 🔄:** Designed as a standalone suite that can be integrated into larger email security systems.
- **Performance Metrics 📊:** Evaluates model performance using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC.

---

## Technical Details 💻

- **Model Architecture:**  
  Our system can be configured to use various deep learning models depending on the use case. The architecture is designed to capture both local and contextual features in email text.
  
- **Data Preprocessing:**  
  Prior to classification, emails undergo cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization. You can integrate pre-trained embeddings (e.g., GloVe or FastText) or use transformer-based embeddings to capture semantic nuances.
  
- **Training Framework:**  
  Developed in Python using popular libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The training pipeline is built for both rapid experimentation and scalability.
  
- **Evaluation:**  
  Model performance is continuously evaluated using a dedicated test set, ensuring robustness against evolving phishing strategies.
